# Lab 0a. Set up your kubernetes environment
 
For the hands-on labs in this tutorial repository, you will need a kubernetes cluster from the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service or any accessable Kubernetes cluster. 

It may take 15-30 minutes to provision a Kubernetes cluster. So, create the cluster before any task in the session.

You may create either a Lite cluster or Paid cluster.

## Use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service

You will need either a paid IBM Cloud account or an IBM Cloud account which is a Trial account (not a Lite account). If you have one of these accounts, use the [Getting Started Guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started) to create your cluster.
