## Lab overview

[Lab 0a](Lab0a): Setup - Provision Kubernetes Cluster. If you do not have access to a kubernetes environment, follow the instructions here to get one. It may take 15-30 minutes to provision a Kubernetes cluster. So, create the cluster as your first task in the session. Otherwise, you may skip these steps.

[Lab 0b](Lab0b): Setup - Pre-requisites.

[Lab 0c](Lab0c): Setup - Connect to your Kubernetes Cluster. Complete these steps to connect to your Kubernetes cluster.

[Lab 1](Lab1): This lab walks through creating and deploying a simple "guestbook" app written in Go as a net/http Server and accessing it.

[Lab 2](Lab2): Builds on lab 1 to expand to a more resilient setup which can survive having containers fail and recover. Lab 2 will also walk through basic services you need to get started with Kubernetes and the IBM Cloud Container Service

[Lab 3](Lab3): Introduces configuration files used to describe deployments and services and their use to deploy an application.
