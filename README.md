## Lab overview

[Lab 0](Lab0): Setup - if you do not have access to a kubernetes environment, follow the suggestions here to get one. If you are in an IBM workshop and have already signed in to your kubernetes cluster, skip this lab and start with [Lab 1](Lab1).

[Lab 1](Lab1): This lab walks through creating and deploying a simple "guestbook" app written in Go as a net/http Server and accessing it.

[Lab 2](Lab2): Builds on lab 1 to expand to a more resilient setup which can survive having containers fail and recover. Lab 2 will also walk through basic services you need to get started with Kubernetes and the IBM Cloud Container Service

[Lab 3](Lab3): Introduces configuration files used to describe deployments and services and their use to deploy an application.
