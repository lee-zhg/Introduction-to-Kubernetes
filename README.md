#  Lab overview

[Lab 1](Lab1): This lab walks through creating and deploying a simple "guestbook" app written in Go as a net/http Server and accessing it.

[Lab 2](Lab2): Builds on lab 1 to expand to a more resilient setup which can survive having containers fail and recover. Lab 2 will also walk through basic services you need to get started with Kubernetes and the IBM Cloud Container Service
